1. State and Explain the Components of a DBMS (Database Management System)
A DBMS is a software system that manages databases. Its key components include:

Database Engine: Handles data storage, retrieval, and updates by processing user queries.
Data Definition Language (DDL): Allows users to define database structure, such as tables, schemas, and indexes.
Data Manipulation Language (DML): Enables data retrieval, insertion, update, and deletion.
Query Processor: Interprets and executes database queries written in SQL or other query languages.
Database Schema: Describes the logical structure of the database, including relationships and constraints.
Transaction Management: Ensures that database transactions are processed reliably and maintain data integrity.
Data Security and Authorization: Protects data from unauthorized access and ensures controlled access based on user roles.
2. What is a Relational Database? Give 4 Examples.
A relational database organizes data into tables with rows (records) and columns (attributes). Relationships between tables are established using keys, making it easy to query and manage data.
Examples:

MySQL
PostgreSQL
Microsoft SQL Server
Oracle Database
3. State and Explain Three Classifications of SQL
SQL can be classified into three main types:

Data Definition Language (DDL): Used to define database structures. Examples: CREATE, ALTER, DROP.
Data Manipulation Language (DML): Used for manipulating data within tables. Examples: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.
Data Control Language (DCL): Used to control access to the database. Examples: GRANT, REVOKE.
4. What is the Difference Between a Primary Key and a Foreign Key?
Primary Key: A unique identifier for each record in a table. It ensures that no duplicate values exist in the column(s) defined as the primary key.
Foreign Key: A column or set of columns in one table that references the primary key in another table, establishing a relationship between the two tables.
5. What is an Entity-Relationship Diagram?
An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) is a visual representation of entities (tables) and their relationships in a database. It uses symbols like rectangles for entities, diamonds for relationships, and ovals for attributes, helping in database design and understanding the data flow.

6. What are the Advantages of Relational Databases?
Data Integrity: Ensures accuracy and consistency of data through constraints like primary keys and foreign keys.
Scalability: Supports large datasets and can handle complex queries efficiently.
Flexibility: Easy to add, update, or delete data without affecting the overall structure.
Security: Role-based access control ensures data protection.
Data Redundancy Elimination: Normalization reduces duplicate data.
7. State Four Types of Data Types Used to Store Data in Tables
Integer: Stores whole numbers (e.g., INT, BIGINT).
String: Stores text (e.g., VARCHAR, CHAR).
Date/Time: Stores dates and timestamps (e.g., DATE, TIMESTAMP).
Decimal/Float: Stores numbers with decimals (e.g., FLOAT, DECIMAL).
8. What is the Purpose of a Database Management System (DBMS)?
A DBMS serves as a bridge between users and the database, allowing for efficient storage, retrieval, and management of data. Its purposes include:

Data Organization: Provides a structured way to store and manage data.
Data Security: Restricts unauthorized access to sensitive information.
Data Integrity: Ensures data accuracy and consistency.
Data Sharing: Facilitates data sharing among multiple users or applications.
Backup and Recovery: Ensures data is not lost and can be restored in case of failure.
